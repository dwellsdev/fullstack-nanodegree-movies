This project includes four files:

- fresh_tomatoes.py - The HTML page generator.
- media.py - Contains movie objects.
- movies.py - The main application that makes objects and calls the function to generate the HTML page.
- README.md - This file.

These files were written and tested with Python 2.7.12.

## How to Use
